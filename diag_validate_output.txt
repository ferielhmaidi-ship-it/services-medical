Mapping
-------

 [FAIL] The entity-class App\Entity\Medecin mapping is invalid:
 * The field App\Entity\Medecin#rendezVous is on the inverse side of a bi-directional relationship, but the specified mappedBy association on the target-entity App\Entity\RendezVous#doctor does not contain the required 'inversedBy: "rendezVous"' attribute.


 [FAIL] The entity-class App\Entity\Patient mapping is invalid:
 * The field App\Entity\Patient#rendezVous is on the inverse side of a bi-directional relationship, but the specified mappedBy association on the target-entity App\Entity\RendezVous#patient does not contain the required 'inversedBy: "rendezVous"' attribute.


Database
